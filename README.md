# OMR Sheet Evaluator - MATLAB

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates the use of **MATLAB** for evaluating **OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets** using image processing techniques.

The project includes two components:
- **Main File**: A script that executes the OMR logic **without a user interface**, displaying the core **image processing workflow**.
- **App File**: A **graphical user interface** (GUI) built using MATLAB's **App Designer**. It integrates both the UI and image processing logic, offering a more interactive experience.

## 🚀 Requirements
- **MATLAB Software** (preferably R2018b or later)
- Image Processing Toolbox

> ⚠️ **Note**: You must have MATLAB installed to run this project.

## 🧠 How It Works
The image processing logic includes:
- Grayscale conversion
- Noise removal
- OMR bubble detection
- Filled vs unfilled detection
- Automatic scoring based on the correct answer key

> 📄 For a detailed explanation of the algorithm and logic, **please refer to `presentation.pdf`** included in the project folder.
